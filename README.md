# Emergency AI Assistant

## üìå Overview

The **Emergency AI Assistant** is a voice-enabled AI system designed to provide immediate assistance during emergencies. It can detect whether the emergency is **medical, crime-related, or fire-related** and respond accordingly. Additionally, for medical emergencies, it fetches and provides the nearest hospital details using **Google Maps API**.

## üöÄ Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Listens to user input using `speech_recognition`.
- **AI-powered Responses**: Uses OpenAI's GPT model for emergency assistance.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts AI responses into speech using `pyttsx3`.
- **Location-based Hospital Search**: Finds the nearest hospital using Google Maps API.
- **Hands-free Interaction**: Operates through voice commands.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **OpenAI API (GPT-4-Turbo)** for AI responses
- **Google Maps API** for location services
- **SpeechRecognition** for voice input
- **Pyttsx3** for text-to-speech conversion
- **Requests** for API calls

## üìÇ Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emergency-ai-assistant.git
cd emergency-ai-assistant
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

```ini
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Program

```bash
python main.py
```

## üé§ How It Works

1. The AI listens to user speech.
2. It identifies the type of emergency.
3. If it's a medical emergency, it fetches nearby hospitals.
4. The AI responds with appropriate guidance via voice.

## üìå Example Usage

- **User**: "There‚Äôs a fire in my building!"
- **AI**: "This is a fire emergency. Please evacuate immediately and call the fire department."

- **User**: "Someone needs medical attention."
- **AI**: "This is a medical emergency. Fetching the nearest hospital details‚Ä¶" _(Provides hospital info)_
